# enu-voter - ENU Block Producer Voting & Wallet

`enu-voter` is a limited-functionality release of a light wallet being designed for the ENU blockchain. This application can be used to connect to a remote ENU API endpoint to perform producer voting actions and a few basic wallet commands.

### Features

- **Block Producer Voting**: Select which block producers to support and cast your vote. Please note that the block producer voting UI is not a research tool; it is a simple interface that provides a secure way to vote.
- **Token Transfers**: Transfer ENU or any other token you may have a balance for to another user or exchanges.
- **CPU/Bandwidth Staking**: Stake your ENU as either Bandwidth or CPU. This grants rights to resource usage on the network, in addition to conveying weight while voting for block producers.
- **Local Wallet**: Set a password while importing your private key to create a local wallet. Your key will be encrypted locally using this password. This password will be required each time you need to unlock the wallet.
- **Temporary Usage**: If you prefer not to store your keys within the application, simply choose not to set a password. When the application quits, your key will be forgotten.

### Security: Private Keys

When using `enu-voter`, all transactions are signed within the application and your key is never transmitted. If a local wallet password is specified, the application will also save and encrypt your key for future use, using AES-256 encryption. The current password/key encryption scheme can [currently be found here](https://github.com/aaroncox/enu-voter/blob/master/app/shared/actions/wallet.js#L71-L86).
